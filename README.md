# Phone-and-eMail_regular-expression
This program allows us to do an extremely tedious task for us to find all phone numbers and e-mail addresses 
on any website or in the document. You just need to press Ctrl + A to select the text that interests you, 
copy it to the clipboard by pressing Ctrl + C, and then run the program. 
After starting up, all found telephone numbers and emails will be displayed.
